## landmark retrieval and recognition (2020)

Work in progress


#### Datasets
Datasets can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-2020/data) (retrieval) and/or [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-2020/data) (recognition). Note that the train image folder (which is most of the data) is the same for both competitions (thus only need to be downloaded once, from either 'retrieval' or 'recognition')
